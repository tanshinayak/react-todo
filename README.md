Project Title:- Todo Application

# Things to install :- node and npm

To start the project first create a demo app using command "npx create-react-app appname" on command prompt
Next step would be go to the src folder in the do the changes that you want to see in the app in the index.js file.

Logic would be to create a state using useState hook which we can change in any function without the issue of scope.
